# Data Science Internship Projects - Codsoft

Welcome to the repository for my data science internship projects at Codsoft. This repository contains five exciting tasks that I have completed as part of my internship. Each task focuses on different aspects of data science, from predictive modeling to unsupervised learning. Below is a brief description of each task.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:** Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

**Description:** This project involves working with historical data about the passengers on the Titanic. Key features include age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. The goal is to create a predictive model using logistic regression to determine the survival probability of passengers.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

**Objective:** Predict movie ratings using regression techniques in Python.

**Description:** This project aims to analyze historical movie data, including features like genre, director, and actors, to develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. Various regression techniques are explored to achieve the best prediction results.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

**Objective:** Implement a machine learning model to classify iris flower species.

**Description:** Using the famous Iris dataset, this task involves building a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Techniques such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM) are used.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Task 4: Customer Segmentation

**Objective:** Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

**Description:** This project involves analyzing customer data to segment them into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. Techniques such as k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are applied to identify and understand different customer segments.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Task 5: Stock Price Prediction

**Objective:** Predict stock prices using time series analysis.

**Description:** In this project, historical stock price data is analyzed to develop a predictive model. Techniques such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks are explored to forecast future stock prices.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- TensorFlow/Keras
